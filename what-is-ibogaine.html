<h1>What Is Ibogaine And How Can It Benefit Your Recovery?</h1>
With countless centuries of history as a means of enriching the soul, and as a tool for rites of passage, Ibogaine’s amazing ability to combat opiate withdrawal were discovered in the late 1960s. Ibogaine actually comes from the root bark of the central West African plant Tabernanthe Iboga – the same plant used for rites of passage and spiritual enrichment. Isolated from the root bark, it is an active alkaloid.

Since the discovery of its medicinal uses in the 1960s, many studies by prominent scientists and academicians have demonstrated can also combat addiction to other substances, including Heroine, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. For a more in depth look into what Ibogaine can treat visit the Ibogaine description and procedures page.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
<h2><strong>What is Ibogaine Treatment and How Does it Combat Addiction</strong></h2>
<em>Opiates</em>

At our facility we only use a pharmaceutical grade medicine with an Ibogaine purity of 99.5%. Ibogaine is effective in combatting opiate withdrawal because it can reset and refresh the opiate receptor sites in the brain. This is the first molecule known to perform such feat, and it is not entirely clear how this feat is performed. Since Ibogaine hydrochloride rests in the receptor sites that would, under most circumstances, house other chemical substances, once the initial treatment is complete, no further work is necessary. This is similar to how drugs like methadone and suboxone work, except that Ibogaine does not need to be taken repeatedly, and is not addictive.

<em>Other Substances</em>

Addiction to other dangerous substances can also be combatted by Ibogaine. Ibogaine is able to function almost like a carbon scrubber, removing these substances from the patient and restoring balance to the patient’s neurochemistry. Those who have undergone the process say that it feels like the memory of addiction, dependency, and cravings are erased from body and mind.

This is effected by both Ibogaine and its metabolite Noribogaine, which work over the course of a few days to clean up the body, restore neurochemistry, and even rebalance such brain chemicals as dopamine, serotonin, endorphins, and adrenaline to their condition prior to the onset of addiction.

Compared to quitting cold turkey, patients feel <em>much </em>less discomfort, as well as fewer symptoms of withdrawal. Under these circumstances, it may take weeks or months to restore the balance of these chemicals. This is especially true of pharmaceutical drugs – these often create not just a physical dependency, but an emotional and psychological one, as well.

In any case, Ibogaine will help to quickly ease the dependencies and cravings – especially if combined with the beginning of a new, healthier way of living.

Incidentally, it is for this very same reason that Ibogaine can affect stimulant dependencies and their related sexual addictions. After it is taken into the system, the Ibogaine travels to the liver, which converts it into Noribogaine. This metabolite builds up in the individual’s fat cells, and reduces both cravings and addictive thought patterns. In some cases, this may require up to 72-96 hours after treatment to really take effect.

Ibogaine also has the ability to combat depression, with well-documented cases of Ibogaine causing feelings of wellness in depression patients, as well as inhibiting the negative thought patterns associated with depression.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
<h4>The Awakened Dream State</h4>
Ibogaine can also help patients on an emotional level. In the first few hours after the treatment has started, there is a merging of the conscious and unconscious minds, which facilitates observations of the events that originally caused their addictions.

This is known as the “awakened dream state.” During this state, many thoughts, feelings, and memories will come out of the shadows of the unconscious mind and float to the surface of a patient’s consciousness. This may even include things of which the patient was previously unaware. This state allows many patients to gain sudden clarity or understanding of events that are partly responsible for their current addiction and behavior patterns.

How Ibogaine is experienced is different for each patient, depending on what chemicals are in their system, their current level of wellness, etc. Not everyone goes through this process visually. No matter how one goes through the process, though, it can be a very helpful part of treatment. That said, even if the patient does not experience any such revelations, the Ibogaine still resets body and mind.[/vc_column_text][vc_video link="https://vimeo.com/113037546"][/vc_column][/vc_row]

                <h1>What to expect from Ibogaine Treatment During Your Personal Journey</h1> Ibogaine treatment involves the use of a herbal medicine. This isn’t the same as psychoactive substance that you can find anywhere. Rather, it’s a treatment that offers complete healing by working on not just your psychological and emotional patterns but also on your spiritual and social life.
                <br>
                <h3>Cost of signing up</h3> The cost of signing up to an Ibogaine treatment center will depend on the type of program you need. Essentially, the entire cost will cover your accommodation and the treatment. Our Ibogaine clinic has private bedrooms and bathrooms. Ibogaine treatment doesn’t require special diet. However, if you’re following a particular diet, you can tell the clinic during reservation. Although you can always bring your friends for your treatment sessions, it’s ideal to focus on yourself during your healing process. Bear in mind that the treatment is not about them. Rather, it’s all about “you.” Your loved ones may want to support you during this process but they may cause distraction, instead of comfort.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Safety</strong> Not every person who wants to get rid of his/her addiction can undergo this type of treatment. You may not be a good candidate for this treatment if you have certain heart problems. Pregnant women may not be allowed to undergo this treatment as it may affect the baby she may be carrying. Thus, before signing up, you’ll need to go through a series of tests to know whether or not you can submit yourself to Ibogaine treatment and take tabernanthe iboga. Our clinic has professionals and therapists who will assist you in every step of your recovery.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Be successful</strong> When you submit yourself to this treatment, it’s imperative that your decision is 100% yours and not influenced by your parents or friends. Why would you like to take it? Is it to be accepted by society? Or you’d like to completely detach yourself from your addiction? You must not be coerced into taking this treatment. It must be your choice. In this way, when you go the center, you have an open mind and the willingness to change without distractions.

                <h2>Side effects of Ibogaine treatment</h2> Each person is different from another.
                <ul>
                    <li>One patient may experience nausea, dizziness and light sensitivity after taking the first dose of iboga.</li>
                    <li>Another patient may have fewer negative effects, like sweating and cold hands.</li>
                    <li>While other patients don’t have those effects.</li>
                </ul>
                The effects of tabernathe Ibogaine on your body will be different. Thus, you should not have expectations on how your journey would go.
