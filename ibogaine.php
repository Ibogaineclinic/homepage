                    <h2><strong>Psychedelic Effects (for those that take a flood dose) </strong></h2> Though Ibogaine is a psychedelic drug, a better way to describe its effects would be "oneirophrenic", or "dream creating". To an observer, the patient experiencing the intial flood dose of Ibogaine treatment would appear to be lying in a state of light sleep. Patients describe their experience as if they are “watching the movie of their life” or “reorganizing some file cabinets within their brain.” Every patient's experience of the treatment is different and unique. The many insights gained into the user’s subconscious and super-conscious mind can become a rock-solid foundation for a life without drug or alcohol addiction.

                    <h2>Ibogaine effects</h2> After an Ibogaine treatment, many people find it easier to handle internal issues that may have encouraged destructive behavior in the past. It also becomes easier to change destructive behaviors, and to be more receptive to therapies. About 75% of patients experience the vivid visual effects that Ibogaine can produce. Many patients sleep through the effects of Ibogaine, or experience quick thoughts and flashes. And, as with other psychedelic drugs,<a href="http://ibogaineclinic.com/ibogaine/"> Ibogaine </a>itself is not addictive.

                    <br>

                    <h2>Ibogaine: Phases of Flood Dose treatment </h2>
                    <br>
                    <h3>What is an Ibogaine Flood Dose?</h3> An Ibogaine flood dose is a calculated measurement of Ibogaine based on the patient's body weight and many other factors. Preparations include hydration, general good health, and psychological preparedness, as well as cardio supporting supplements. Most people, after taking a flood dose, experience the onset of effects in phases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Timetable of Ibogaine customized Protocol</strong></h3> David and his team have discovered over the years that Ibogaine treatment is not a one-size-fits-all practice. Each person's physiological make-up and addiction is different; as such, treatments should be just as customizable. To achieve the best possible results, David has developed many different<a href="http://ibogaineclinic.com/ibogaine/"> Ibogaine </a>treatment protocols to maximize both the efficiency and its results. Because of this, the time and intensity of each treatment will vary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Phase One: Effect Onset</h4> After the treatment begins, most patients will experience a gradual change in how their body feels. Opiate addicts will often experience 100% relief from withdrawal symptoms durring the first treatment.
                    <br>
                    <br> Somtimes after the exsperience begins for heavy drug users, patients will need help moving around, especially when visiting the restroom. During this time, many patients will also experience low-grade visualization.
                    <h4>Phase Two: Visionary Dreams, 4 hours. The “Peak” Experience</h4> During Phase Two, most patients will experience bodily heaviness; some may experience nausea, as well – in the latter case, simply keeping the head still can lessen this effect. Patients may become confused during this phase of the process, as the treatment’s stranger effects become stronger.
                    <br>
                    <br> 5% report having no visual experience at all, some people will experience visions or visual hallucinations. These are different from person to person, but often contain common themes such as ancestry, mythology, animals, and plants. 5% of patients will sleep during this 'peak' period, 5% will experience visions, but have no memory of them. All of these are carefully monitored by our medical team.
                    <br>

                    <h4>Phase Three: Introspection, 6-18 hours. “Coming Down.”</h4> After completing an Ibogaine treatment, participants will regain control over their bodies, and side effects like nausea and vomiting will stop. At this point, the body will often be dehydrated, so the patient may experience headaches before liquids are introduced to start the rehydration process.  Many people sleep for periods during Phase 3, while others simply sit impatiently. Most will be able to begin processing their visual experience and start addressing any personal issues that may have lead to the original destructive behavior underlying their addiction. The end of Phase Three is normally marked with a light meal.
                    <br>
                    <br> Additionally, many patients experience a 'Gray Day' after completing an Ibogaine Flood Dose treatment.
                    <h5>What Is Gray Day?</h5> A "Gray Day" is a common side effect that many patients experience after completing an Ibogaine treatment. It is defined as a "physiological, psychological and emotional cluster" that will often present itself as negativity, depression, sadness, and intellectual self-abuse. These effects will gradually wear off during the day, some participants have a tough time breaking free from these feelings.  Not everyone experiences this gray day, but everyone should be prepared for one.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2><strong>Long Term Ibogaine Side Effects</strong></h2> After Phase Three is complete, and patients have made their way through their 'gray day', the final results manifest differently for each user. Most of the result depends on what the original intention of the treatment was. It can also be helped or lessened by ongoing lifestyle.
                    <br>
                    <br> Most after effects are attributed to the metabolite Noribogaine. This is created as a byproduct of the liver metabolizing Ibogaine, and can persist in the body for up to six month after the initial treatment. Noribogaine is a powerfull antidpressent and thyroid stablizer.
