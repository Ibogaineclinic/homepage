                    <h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBOGAINE AND YOUR PERSONAL RECOVERY JOURNEY</span></h1>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have gone from website to website attempting to understand the psychoactive Ibogaine. To comprehend its healing properties. Like pilgrims seeking to learn what Ibogaine is and how Ibogaine can be used to combat your addiction. Or its ability to stimulate self-healing of other physical and mental ailments.</span>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps you’ve been guided here by a friend or loved one. Perhaps you’ve reached such a state of hopelessness and despair in mind, body, and spirit. Maybe you are left with no choice but to take the next step to freedom. Ibogaine is the guide to self-discovery and true healing that you have searched for so many years.</span>
                    <h2><b>WHAT WE TREAT</b></h2>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Ibogaine clinic treats a variety of different ailments, from PTSD to crohn's disease. The most common use for Ibogaine is detox. To end opiate addiction immediately while avoiding withdrawal symptoms. While Ibogaine’s effectiveness in dealing with opiates is absolutely remarkable. Ibogaine is also incredibly potent treatment for many substance addictions, including alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and nicotine. Even synthetic opiates such as methadone, Subutex or Suboxone. If you are struggling with an addiction, we can help you, too. Ibogaine force's your body to heal itself, shattering the grip of these substances on your mind, body, and soul.</span>
                    <h2><b>IBOGAINE – THE CURE FOR MODERN SOCIETY</b></h2>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Excessive intake of drugs and alcohol facilitate much that is abhorrent in our society today. Such as family loss, crime, and human suffering many times have roots in addictive and mind altering substances.</span>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite great advances in our knowledge of biochemistry, few pharmaceuticals have proven themselves to be effective in the treatment of addiction. The world of addiction is in desperate need of a true self-healing molecule. Many neuroscience researchers, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists contend that Ibogaine is that molecule. Our clinic has shown time and time again that Ibogaine can help liberate addicts from the clutches of their drug and alcohol addictions. Allowing peace and freedom to return to their lives.</span>

                    <h2><strong>Psychedelic Effects</strong></h2> Though Ibogaine is a psychedelic drug, a better way to describe its effects would be oneirophrenic, or "dream creating". To an observer, the patient experiencing the Ibogaine treatment would appear to be lying in a state of light sleep. Patients describe their experience as if they are “watching the movie of their life” or “reorganizing some file cabinets within their brain.” Every patient's experience of the treatment is as different and unique as they, themselves, are. The many insights gained into the user’s subconscious and super-conscious mind can become a rock-solid foundation for a life without drug or alcohol addiction.

                <div class="col col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                    <h2>Ibogaine effects</h2> After an Ibogaine treatment, many people find it easier to handle internal issues that may have encouraged destructive behavior in the past. It also becomes easier to change destructive behaviors, and to be more receptive to therapies. Only about 75% of patients experience the vivid visual effects that the drug can produce. Many patients sleep through the effects of the drug, or experience quick thoughts and flashes. The properties of Ibogaine still work on these individuals, whether or not they experience the hallucinations. And, as with other psychedelic drugs, Ibogaine itself is not addictive.

                    <h1>What to expect from Ibogaine Treatment During Your Personal Journey</h1> Ibogaine treatment involves the use of a herbal medicine. This isn’t the same as psychoactive substance that you can find anywhere. Rather, it’s a treatment that offers complete healing by working on not just your psychological and emotional patterns but also on your spiritual and social life.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Cost of signing up</h3> The cost of signing up to an Ibogaine treatment center will depend on the type of program you need. Essentially, the entire cost will cover your accommodation and the treatment. Our Ibogaine clinic has private bedrooms and bathrooms. Ibogaine treatment doesn’t require special diet. However, if you’re following a particular diet, you can tell the clinic during reservation. You can always bring your friends for your treatment sessions, although it’s ideal to focus on yourself during your healing process. Bear in mind that the treatment is not about them. Rather, it’s about “you.” Your loved ones may want to support you during this process but they may cause distraction, instead of comfort.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <strong>Be successful</strong> When you submit yourself to this treatment, it’s imperative that your decision is 100% yours and not influenced by your parents or friends.

                        <li>One patient may experience nausea, dizziness and light sensitivity after taking the first dose of iboga.</li>
                        <li>Another patient may have fewer negative effects, like sweating and cold hands.</li>
                        <li>While other patients don’t have those effects.</li>

                    <h1>Ibogaine Side Effects and Effects</h1> Ibogaine has unique characteristics as a drug, and its effects are very hard to explain to patients who have not experienced it. There are a number of side effects that are common to an Ibogaine treatment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2><strong>Timetable of Traditional Ibogaine Flood Dose Process</strong></h2>
                    <h3>What is an Ibogaine flood dose?</h3> An Ibogaine flood dose is a measurement of Iboga or Ibogaine calculated based on the patient's body weight. This measurement is designed to provide a lengthy psychedelic experience. A flood dose is the same quantity for all treatment plans. Preparations include hydration, general good health, and psychological preparedness, as well as intestinal motility and cardio supporting supplements. Most people, after taking a flood dose, experience the onset of effects in phases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Timetable Of Ibogaine customized Protocol at Ibogaine by David Dardshti</strong></h3> David and his team have discovered over the years that Ibogaine treatment is not a one-size-fits-all practice. Each person's physiological make-up and addiction is different; as such, treatments should be just as customizable. To achieve the best possible results, David has developed 18 different Ibogaine treatment protocols to maximize both the drug's efficiency and its results. Because of this, the time and intensity of each treatment will vary.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Phase One: Effect Onset</h4> After the treatment begins, most patients will experience a gradual change in how their body feels. Opiate addicts will often experience up to 100% relief from withdrawal symptoms.
                    <br>
                    <br> Most patients will experience a short-lived auditory hallucination, such as buzzing or humming. Once the effect onset is complete, patients should expect to experience ataxia, or the loss of voluntary muscle control. Once this begins, patients will need help moving around, especially when visiting the restroom. During this time, many patients will also experience low-grade visualization. Some have described a feeling of stress and anxiety which are both considered normal during the use of psychedelic drugs.
                    <h4>Phase Two: Visionary Dreams, 5-8 hours. The “Peak” Experience</h4> During Phase Two, most patients will experience bodily heaviness accompanied by ataxia; some may experience nausea, as well – in the latter case, simply keeping the head still can ameliorate this effect. Patients often become confused during this segment of the process, as the treatment’s stranger effects become stronger.
                    <br>
                    <br> Some people will experience visions or visual hallucinations. These are different from person to person, but often contain common themes such as ancestry, mythology, animals, and plants. About 5% of patients will sleep during this 'peak' period, another 5% report having no visual experience at all, and still another 5% will experience visions, but have no memory of them.
                    <br>
                    <br> Normal side effects during this phase are difficulty moving, vomiting, and some mild cardiac arrhythmia, all of which are carefully monitored by our medical team.
                    <h4>Phase Three: Introspection, 6-18 hours. “Coming Down.”</h4> After completing an Ibogaine treatment, participants will slowly regain control over their bodies, and side effects like nausea and vomiting will slowly stop.  At this point, the body will often be dehydrated, so the patient may experience headaches before liquids are introduced to start the rehydration process.  Many people sleep for short periods during Phase 3, while others simply sit impatiently. Most will be able to begin processing their visual experience and start addressing the personal issues that may have lead to the original destructive behavior underlying their addiction. The end of Phase Three is normally marked with a light meal.
                    <br>
                    <br> Additionally, many patients experience a 'Gray Day' after completing an Ibogaine treatment.
                    <h5>What Is Gray Day?</h5> A "Gray Day" is a common side effect that many patients experience after completing an Ibogaine treatment. It is defined as a physiological, psychological and emotional cluster that will often present itself as bad body image, negativity, depression, sadness, and intellectual self-abuse. Though these effects will gradually wear off during the day, some participants have a tough time breaking free from these feelings.  Not everyone experiences this gray day, but everyone should be prepared for one.
                    <br>
                    <br> Gray days may last longer than a day or two, and many patients experience these 'blues' for several days after an Ibogaine treatment.
                    <h2><strong>Long Term Ibogaine Side Effects</strong></h2> After Phase Three is complete, and patients have made their way through their 'gray day', the final results manifest differently for each user. Most of the result depends on what the original intention of the treatment was, as well as the planning and ongoing effort that are put into whatever lifestyle change the Ibogaine treatment was used for.
                    <br>
                    <br> Most aftereffects are attributed to the metabolite Noribogaine. This is created as a byproduct of the liver metabolizing Ibogaine, and can persist in the body for up to two month after the initial treatment.
